It's a ZNC "mode"

Aint that exciting?

$ git clone https://sshirokov@github.com/sshirokov/ZNC.el.git

Make sure the contents of the repo, or just ./znc.el is on your load-path.

;; Install
(require 'znc)

;; Configure
M-x customize-group znc RET

;; Engage!
; It'll prompt you for a configured server, or tell you to configure one
M-x znc-erc

; Or you can make a giant sweep and connect to freaking everything
M-x znc-all

;; Usage
/reconnect will recycle the hell out of the server buffer.

By default, when you kill a channel buffer instead of /parting from the channel, you will detach from it
This is customizable

You can also get ZNC.el from the Marmalade ELPA repository. See http://marmalade-repo.org/ for instructions on using Marmalade.
